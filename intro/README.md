# HBase Intro
-----


## STEP 1: View HBASE Web Interface
Hbase master dashboard can be accessed via a browser:
(instructor will provide details)

Try to find answer to the following questions:
* Q : What is the version of  HBase?
* Q : What tables do you see?  Note the system tables and the user tables
* Q : how many region servers do you see in the cluster?
* Q : How many regions each region server is hosting?  is the number evenly split across cluster?


## STEP 2: Using 'hbase' Command
On terminal invoke 'hbase'
```
    $ hbase
    Usage: hbase <command>
```

**=> Q : Find out the version of hbase using CLI **  


## STEP 3: Hbase Shell
Invoke hbase shell in a terminal
```
    $ hbase shell
```
    
Try the 'help' command in HBase shell prompt
```
    hbase> help
```

To find help for a specific command use
```
    hbase>   help 'create'
```
(don't forget the quotes)

## STEP 4: See all tables
HINT : use `list` command


## STEP 5: Find out the 'status' of the cluster:
Hint : `status` command

**=> Q : Can you get `detailed` status ?**  
Hint : `help "status"`   (don't forget the quotes)



## STEP 6: Creating TABLE Using Hbase Shell
We are going to create a table named `MY_NAME_test` with one family named 'd'
Replace MY_NAME with your name :)

```
    hbase> create 'MY_NAME_test', 'd'

    # example
    hbase> create 'sujee_test', 'd'
    0 row(s) in 1.1120 seconds
```

Use the `list` command to verify the table exists
```
    hbase> list
```

**=> Q : Think about why we are using short names for family (e.g.  `d`  or `f1`) instead of `my first family` ?**  
(answer on slide HBASE03-InDepth ,   page 10)

## STEP 7: Find Out More About The Table
Hint : `describe`   
Inspect the output produced by HBase


## STEP 8: Insert Some Rows Into `MY_NAME_test` Table
Put command works like this:
```
    put <table name>  <row key>   <column_famly : column>    <value>
```
Here is a sample usage:
```
    hbase>  put 'MY_NAME_test', 'r1', 'd:c1', 'foo'
    hbase>  put 'MY_NAME_test', 'r1', 'd:c2', 'bar'
    hbase>  put 'MY_NAME_test', 'r2', 'd:c1', 'baz'
```


## STEP 9: inspect a row
Hint: Use `get`.   Use `help  "get"` to see usage


## STEP 10: find out the contents of the table
Hint : use `scan`  

Inspect the output.  Output may look similar to:
```
    ROW                           COLUMN+CELL
     r1                           column=d:c1, timestamp=1365320206055, value=foo

     r1                           column=d:c2, timestamp=1365320238460, value=bar

     r2                           column=d:c1, timestamp=1365320505407, value=baz

     2 row(s) in 0.0420 seconds
```

Note the timestamps, Hbase inserts timestamps automatically (we can over-ride this)

Scan takes arguments like VERSIONS, LIMIT ...
Try the limit option


## STEP 11:  Over-ride a value
```
    hbase>  put 'MY_NAME_test', 'r1', 'd:c1', 'foonew'
```

Scan the table.  What value do see for  `r1:d:c1` ?

**=> Q : can you see the old value of `r1:d:c1` ? **  
Hint : `help 'scan'`  (look at VERSIONS option)


## STEP 12: Count Number Of Rows In A Table
Hint : `count`  (`help 'count'`)


## STEP 13: delete a (any) cell value of row 'r1'
Hint : `help 'delete'`  

```
    hbase>  delete <table> , <row>,  '<family>:<column>'
```

Do a `scan` after the delete.


## STEP 14: Examine The Tables In HBase UI
Look at the user tables in HBase UI?  
Click on them and explore.   
**=> Q : How many regions do you see now?  Are they distributed evenly across the cluster? **   



## STEP 15: Examining HBase Files in HDFS
HBase stores data in HDFS. 
Open HDFS Web UI or  Hue Web UI.   
Navigate to directory : `/hbase`   
Explore the directory structure.   
**=> Q : how are the tables stored?**   

Navigate to your table directory.   
**=> Q : Do you see more directories under there?  What do they represent? **   
Navigate further into the dir structure.  
Do you see the actual file where data is stored?   
If not, your table hasn't be saved to disk yet (not flushed).   
Go to HBase shell and flush your table.  
HINT : `flush 'table_name'`.   

Now inspect  HDFS storage directory, do you see the data file?.


## STEP 15:  Delete The Entire Table You Just Created
Hint : `drop`


## BONUS Lab:
Create another table with two column families `f1`  and `f2`.  

* f1 has 1 VERSIONs
* f2 has 2 VERSIONs

Hint : `help 'create'`
