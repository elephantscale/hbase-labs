Lab : Use HBase Java APIs for CRUD
Query (R)
----

project dir : HI-labs/hadoop-dev/hbase/crud
you can also open the project in eclipse

== STEP 1)
    $   cd crud
    edit the file : src/main/hi/hbase/Query.java


== STEP 2) complete the TODO items
Refer HBase javadocs for class methods


== STEP 3) compile the code:
    $ cd crud
    $ ../compile.sh
this should create a jar file called 'a.jar'


== STEP 4) query
inspect the file : query.sh
And execute it
    $ ./query.sh
    or
    $ sh query.sh

The output might look like:

    querying for userId : 39
         email=user-39@foo.com
         query time : 0.0060 ms

    querying for userId : 191
         not found
         query time : 0.041 ms

We try to query some random userIds.  Take a look at the query time, they are pretty good (in milli seconds or sub-ms range!)


== BONUS LAB)  get all column familes and columns for a row
think 'select *'
Hint : consult javadocs for Get
Can you figure out the types for each column values?
