Lab : Scan sensor data
----
project dir : HI-labs/hadoop-dev/hbase/sensor
you can also open the project in eclipse

== STEP 1)
    $   cd sensor
    edit the file : src/main/hi/hbase/SensorQuery.java


== STEP 2) complete the TODO items
Refer HBase javadocs for class methods


== STEP 3) compile the code:
    $ cd sensor
    $ ../compile.sh
this should create a jar file called 'a.jar'


== STEP 4) query for data for a specific sensorId
Provide an integer value for sensor_id (e.g 25)
Use the run script
    $ ./run.sh   hi.hbase.SensorQuery  <sensor_id>
    or
    $ sh run.sh  hi.hbase.SensorInsert  <sensor_id>


== STEP 5)  inspect timestamps and temperature from output
what is the order of records?


== BONUS LAB 1)  Find maximum temperature for a sensor_id, and the time it occurred


== BONUS LAB 2)  get all column familes and columns for a row
think 'select *'
Hint : consult javadocs for Result
Can you figure out the types for each column values?


== BONUS LAB 3)  'wide table'
If you had done the wide-table challenge from insert, now query the records using the wide table schema
Is there a sorting order to the results?
