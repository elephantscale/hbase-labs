Lab : Inserting sensor data
----

project dir : HI-labs/hadoop-dev/hbase/sensor
you can also open the project in eclipse

== STEP 1)
    $   cd sensor
    edit the file : src/main/hi/hbase/Insert.java


== STEP 2) complete the TODO items
Refer HBase javadocs for class methods


== STEP 3) compile the code:
    $ cd sensor
    $ ../compile.sh
this should create a jar file called 'a.jar'


== STEP 4) insert data
Use the run script
    $ ./run.sh   hi.hbase.SensorInsert
    or
    $ sh run.sh  hi.hbase.SensorInsert




== BONUS LAB)  Use 'wide table' schema
Currently we are using tall table design.
How will you change this design for a wide table?
one sensor will have ONE row.
each timestamp would be a column
How would you store multiple values (temperature, humidity) for a single timestamp?
