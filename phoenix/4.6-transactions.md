Lab 4.6: Transactions
===============

### Overview

The goal here is to use the same transaction data as done in Hive.
Apply all modeling exercises, experiment with data

* Design transactions tables
* populate the tables with data

Note: Phoenix installed on our Hadoop cluster. For this lab, we recommend using it. However, you can continue
working with your Phoenix install that you have created in Lab 4.1

### Builds on
None

### Run time
approx. 20 minutes

### Working directory
`hadoop-adv-labs/4-hbase/`


## STEP 1: Connect to Phoenix     
    
To start the Phoenix shell, called `sqlline`

     
```bash
    $  ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py   <internal-ip-of-zookeeper>:2181:/hbase
```
     
For example, your command may like as follows
```bash 
     $   ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py    localhost:2181:/hbase
     # or 
     $   ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py    ip-10-16-184-103.ec2.internal:2181:/hbase
```

## STEP 2: TRANSACTIONS

Provided that you create, or have already created a table as follows (notice the use of your name)
    
```
  phoenix> 
       CREATE TABLE <your-name>_TRANSACTIONS (
            id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
            account_id INTEGER,
            vendor_id INTEGER,
            time VARCHAR,
            city VARCHAR,
            state VARCHAR ,
            amount DOUBLE);


```

Copy the following

To generate the data, run the following command in the `4-hbase/generators` folder in the lab
```bash    
    $  hdfs dfs -get /data/transactions/in/*
```
    
To load the data, exit `sqlline`, then do the following command
    
```
    $ ~/phoenix/bin/psql.py -t <your-name>_TRANSACTIONS localhost:/hbase *.csv
```
    

Note: table name for Phoenix import should be all upper case. `sqlline` is permissive, by `psql' is not.    
    


## STEP 3: VENDORS

#### Create table (if not already created)

```
    phoenix>
            CREATE TABLE <your-name>_VENDORS (
               id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
               name VARCHAR,
               city VARCHAR,
               state VARCHAR,
               category VARCHAR ,
               swipe_rate DOUBLE)
            );
```

## STEP 4: ACCOUNTS

#### Create table (if not already created)

```
    phoenix>
            CREATE TABLE <your-name>_ACCOUNTS (
               id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
               accountNo INTEGER,
               bankID INTEGER,
               first_name VARCHAR,
               last_name VARCHAR,
               email VARCHAR,
               gender VARCHAR,
               address VARCHAR,
               city VARCHAR,
               state VARCHAR,
               zip VARCHAR)
            );
```
