Lab 4.3 : HBase and Phoenix install
===================================

### Overview
Getting familiar with Phoenix install

Note: we have Phoenix installed on our Hadoop cluster. However, we do this lab to get a feel for Phoenix install
and for possible problems one might encounter

INSTRUCTOR will provide each student with a fresh clean cloud instance for this install (ES regular Hadoop image, m3.large, with hadoop security group)

### Builds on
None

### Run time
approx. 15 minutes

### Working directory
`hadoop-adv-labs/4-hbase/`

### STEP 1: Install HBase

Install HBase by downloading the tar ball from Apache, [http://hbase.apache.org/](http://hbase.apache.org/)

For example, you might do steps similar to these
    
    wget http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com/hbase/1.1.2/hbase-1.1.2-bin.tar.gz
    tar xf hbase-1.1.2-bin.tar.gz
    cd hbase-1.1.2
    export JAVA_HOME=~/apps/jdk7
    ./bin/start-hbase.sh 

Verify HBase operation
    
Start HBase shell
    
    ./bin/hbase shell
    
Now inside the shell
    
    status
    create  'aha', 'd'
    list
    put 'aha', 'row1', 'd:a', 'value1'
    scan 'aha'
    ... do anything else you want
    exit
    
Verify by opening the following URL in the browser (note the port change in the latest HBase): http://<your-instance):16010

For example,

    http://ec2-54-204-187-160.compute-1.amazonaws.com:16010   
        
Verify that ZooKeeper is running in the local mode, controlled by HBase        
    
    
### STEP 2: Install Phoenix

Install Phoenix by downloading it from Apache, [http://phoenix.apache.org/](http://phoenix.apache.org/)

For example, you might do steps similar to these

    cd
    wget http://apache.mirrorcatalogs.com/phoenix/phoenix-4.5.2-HBase-1.1/bin/phoenix-4.5.2-HBase-1.1-bin.tar.gz
    tar xf phoenix-4.5.2-HBase-1.1-bin.tar.gz
    cd phoenix-4.5.2-HBase-1.1-bin
    
Start the Phoenix shell
    
    ./bin/sqlline.py localhost:2181
    
You can omit the port    

    ./bin/sqlline.py localhost
    
Note that you connect to the right ZooKeeper - and yet you get an error    
    
    
### STEP 3: Install Phoenix jars in HBase

Now follow the install instructions for HBase and Phoenix, that is,

* copy phoenix*jar to hbase/lib
* restart hbase

For example, your commands may look as follows

    cd hbase-1.1.2
    ./bin/stop-hbase.sh
    cp ~/phoenix-4.5.2-HBase-1.1-bin/phoenix-*.jar lib/
    ./bin/start-hbase.sh
     
Restart Phoenix shell
     
    ./bin/sqlline.py localhost    

Try the following commands
        
     !help
     
     !tables
     
(Note: before at least one of the user tables has data, user table names are not diplayed. Bug?)
     
Exit the shell:

    !exit
    
We will use the shell in the next lab
    
### STEP 4: Compare to cluster install
    
Go back to the slides, compare and relate the cluster install instruction back to this lab
