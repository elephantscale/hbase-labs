Lab 4.6: Phoenix and Hive
===============

### Overview

We will be comparing the performance of Hbase vs Phoenix

### Builds on
4.5 CC Data

### Run time
approx. 20 minutes

### Working directory
`hbase-labs/phoenix/`


## STEP 1: Connect to Phoenix     
    
To start the Phoenix shell, called `sqlline`

     
```bash
    $  ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py   <internal-ip-of-zookeeper>:2181:/hbase
```
     
For example, your command may like as follows
```bash 
     $   ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py    localhost:2181:/hbase
     # or 
     $   ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py    ip-10-16-184-103.ec2.internal:2181:/hbase
```

## STEP 2: Verify that your TRANSACTIONS table exists

In Phoenix, make sure you have your transactions table; if not go back to the previous labs.
    


## STEP 3: Create the phoenix table in hbase

Go to Hive.

```bash
hive
```

#### Create external table in hive (if not already created)

```
    hive> use YOUR_NAME_db; 

    hive>
ADD JAR /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix/lib/phoenix-core-5.0.0.7.1.3.0-100.jar;
ADD JAR /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/phoenix/lib/phoenix-hive-5.0.0.7.1.3.0-100.jar;
ADD JAR /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/jars/htrace-core4-4.1.0-incubating.jar;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE transactions_phx (
    id INT,
    account_id INT,
    vendor_id INT,
    `time` STRING,
    city STRING,
    state STRING ,
    amount DOUBLE)
STORED BY 'org.apache.phoenix.hive.PhoenixStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES (
  "phoenix.table.name" = "ext_table",
  "phoenix.zookeeper.quorum" = "localhost",
  "phoenix.zookeeper.znode.parent" = "/hbase",
  "phoenix.zookeeper.client.port" = "2181",
  "phoenix.rowkeys" = "id",
  "phoenix.column.mapping" = "account_id:account_id, vendor_id:vendor_id, `time`:`time`, city:city, state:state, amount:amount"
);


```

### STEP 4: Perform a query in hive

This is querying from a pure hive table:

```
  hive> use MY_NAME_db;
  select account_id, SUM(amount) as total from YOUR_NAME_transactions_phx group by account_id order by total desc limit 10;
```

This is querying from the phoenix table

```
  hive> use MY_NAME_db;
  select account_id, SUM(amount) as total from YOUR_NAME_transactions_phx group by account_id order by total desc limit 10;
```


### Step 5: Perform the query in Phoenix

This is the phoenix auery:

```bash
    $  ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py   <internal-ip-of-zookeeper>:2181:/hbase
```

```
phoenix>

select account_id, SUM(amount) as total from YOUR_NAME_transactions group by account_id order by total desc limit 10;


Compare the speed of the queries.  Which query was faster?
